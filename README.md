Change logic of scripts yourself

Autofarmer and other feature is not hard to implement, logic is basically here:[url](https://github.com/ogame-ninja/scripts/blob/master/community/cremefresh55/OptimalFarmerNoTimer.go)

I started learning GO and making this script at the same time, so be nice to a new comer

I hate handling errors....

GOLang is awesome

Did not dockerize it since I found that people will not trust my docker image...
